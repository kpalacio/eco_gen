There is a R script in teh project data calss folder. We need to copy that file to our desktop folder. To do that, First I will open terminal (CYGWIN) an link into my desktop folder:

 cd C:/Users/Kti/Desktop/eco_gen

Once I am in my desktop folder from terminal I will run the followin comnd to copy the file:
scp kpalacio@pbio381.uvm.edu:/data/project_data/DGE/* .

Now, from my desktop folder I will run teh R script in R studio. I need to install fisrt the different libraries.

in my script foler I have teh file tail.sam. I open this file with vim and I am able to see the flag  (number with information abiut mapping success and orientation and whether the read is left or right. We check teh number of teh flag online. link: sam flag decoder

we are going ove the interpretation of teh sam file. In my case I have 09_5-08_H_0_bwaaln.sam If I go at the end of each line (I can o with $), I will find collumns with X0:i:U, XT:i:4, to get info about what thsi columns means , check the tutorial.
We want unic read to match with teh reference genome. To subset fot them, we can use grep command, or countexpression_pe.py. "countxpression_PE.py"This is a python script comand. This pyton script do not like long names, that's why we need to change the names. 

Now we will open the scripts of pyton. It is in data/scripts.
In order to run the script you need to call python program. Check tutotial 
This scripts create a library . It extract info for particular read in order to count how many read match. It conver the sam file in a table for a a single gene that it is a reference genome. 
---
we first remove the :: from the sam file we used sed -i "s/::/\_g" myfile.sam
Then we copy the python script that is in data scripts and I paste it in my scripts:
cp namefilethatIwanttocopy ~/scripts/
ones teh scripts is in my script dolder, I will run teh python script:
python ..... check tutorial.
At the end. I will have  2 counts file:
09_5-08_H_0_bwaaln_counts.txt #it contains teh table
countstatssummary.txt #it contains statistic

Tutorial RNA seq:
$ /data/popgen/TransDecoder-3.0.1/TransDecoder.LongOrfs -t Trinity.fasta
Melisa built a reference genome for the whole class. The tutorial show how she made it. This reference is from a single individual. 
today we will map reads from individual samples to reference transcriptome
 
We change the file bwaaln_kpl by putting our R1 file name. after saving it we run the file by:
./nameof file and enter.... no space!
 after this finish running, I should get a sam file  and two sai files
.sam
R1....sai
R2....sai

creat a sample of the .sam file:
tail -n 100 nameoffile > nameofnewshortfile

to kill aprocess: ctrl+C

Last monday I clean only one file, so today I start cleaning my second file. For this I run :
to run fastaqc to check quality
cd /data/project_data/fastq/
then I run teh comand 
fastqc 09_5-08_H_0_R2.fq.gz
it produce a new html file
09_5-08_H_0_R2_fastqc.html
now i need to move it 

After run the trimmm file and it is in clean. I need to run again teh fastqc
on teh clean file that is in clean folder
fastqc 09_5-08_H_0_R2.fq.gz_clean_unpaired.fa

Now I should have an html file and this is teh one that I need to dowonload to my computer. For thsi I will use the program WinSCP. Select teh two html files and drag into my folder on my pc. This forder is in teh desktop_Eco_Gen
Now if I go to my desktop, I can double click an open the file in teh inetrnet.

To check:
Adapter content, etc

Now we want to do teh assembly. As an exercise, and because the assambly can be affected by different things, we want to do a little experiment asbout how teh assamble can be affected by differnet variables.
For sure we want to use the pair.fa files
We want to choose an individual and then comapre sick versus healthy. 
we want to use melany files: user lchambel 
teh assembly can be affected by: 
the lenght of teh read, etc

check tutorial  Trinity --
you can run the trinity stats!!!
Leaving now :11:34 am




###02-5-2017
path for directory:
data, project_data, fastaq

my file:
09_5-08_H_0_R1.fq.gz
09_5-08_H_0_R2.fq.gz
individual
date
0 healthy, 5 super sich
R1 right readd, R2 left read

I need to clean, evaluate and clean again this sample!

To look at the file. zip file
zcat filename | head

we want to see letters

we want to clean teh file using fastqc
change directory to scripts
we passte a file into that folder trim_example and in that file we change the names of our files to clean.
For cleaning we are using a java program that need some especifications, to do that we edit teh file trim... using vim

after editing your trim_example file. you want to run your script
for running we have 2 differnet was:
1: ./filename
2. basg filename

let it run. you can open a new  terminal window and tpe top to see the progress

this is teh info after running teh file
Input Read Pairs: 14120990 Both Surviving: 11763574 (83.31%) Forward Only Surviving: 1762305 (12.48%) Reverse Only Surviving: 221527 (1.57%) Dropped: 373584 (2.65%)
TrimmomaticPE: Completed successfully

to run fastaqc to check quality
cd /data/project_data/fastq/
then I run teh comand 
fastqc 09_5-08_H_0_R1.fq.gz
it produce a new html file
09_5-08_H_0_R1_fastqc.html
now i need to move it
